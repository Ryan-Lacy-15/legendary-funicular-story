This is a story about a boy named Andrew. When Andrew was 16, he grew restless with his life in Southern California and decided he needed an adventure. Much to the chagrin of his helicopter parents, he decided that over the course of the summer he was going to bike from Vancouver, through Washington, Oregon, and California, all the way to Mexico.  This is the story of his travels through those states.
